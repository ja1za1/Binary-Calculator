# Binary calculator

This program receives two decimal numbers and convert them to binary using two's complement. The user can choose between two operations (sum and subtraction) to do with the numbers. Then the operation chosen is made with the numbers in binary and the result(if the operation doesn't cause an overflow) is printed on the screen in binary and decimal.
